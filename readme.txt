Template plugin for scaffolding WordPress plugins at XWP.

== Description ==

Use the [`init-plugin.sh`](init-plugin.sh) bash script to enter an interactive shell on your system, which attempts to copy this repo while making necessary string replacements:

```bash
./init-plugin.sh
```

The `init-plugin.sh` script will be removed from the generated plugin. You should also update your new `readme.txt` and add any config files your project may need, read more about your options in the [`xwp/wp-dev-lib/readme.md`](https://github.com/xwp/wp-dev-lib) file.
