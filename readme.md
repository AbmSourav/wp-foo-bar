## Description ##

Use the [`init-plugin.sh`](init-plugin.sh) bash script to scaffold a new plugin. The script will enter an interactive shell on your host machine and copy this plugin while making necessary string replacements:

```bash
./init-plugin.sh
```

The `init-plugin.sh` script will be removed from the generated plugin. You should also update your `readme.txt` and add/change any of the config files your project may need, read more about your options in the [`xwp/wp-dev-lib/readme.md`](https://github.com/xwp/wp-dev-lib) file.

**Coveralls Pro**
